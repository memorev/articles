# What is memorev
memorev is my attempt at adding proper documentation to the Syrain revolution of 2011.
Do not get me wrong alot of Youtube videos, news article, etc already exist but
sadly they are not centrelized and it is hard to tell what is true from what is
fake. I hope that memorev can oneday become the Wikipedia of the Syrian revolution.
Meaning a place where everyone can contribute but all pages are verified.
# What is the point?
There is no point. The international community has never paid attention to us.
The people that could have revolted have already done so and the rest are either
afraid or too stupid to revolt. Memorev is just an attempt to keep the revolution
alive in the hearts of the Syrian people.
