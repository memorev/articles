# How can I contribute
You can contribute by adding some pages, fixing bugs, adding features, if the
project gets large enough by translating some pages (when a langauge feature)
gets added or by donations (that is if the project becomes large).
# How can I add a new page
The simplest way to add a page is to shoot me an email: memorev@protonmail.com.
Just send me the contents of the page and I will do the fortmatting, add it to
the db, etc. If you want to do everything yourself, first create a github account
then open a pull request on the
[pages repo](https://github.com/memorev/articles) with the changes you
want to add but make sure you read the CONTRIBUTING.md file before opening a PR.
# How do I contribute to the code
In order to contribute to the code, you must have experience in React, TypeScript
HTML, CSS and git. Read the CONTRIBUTING.md of the
[website repo](https://example.com) before opening a PR.
# Translating
It would be nice to have pages in Arabic, Kurdish and Syriac. I would
translate it to Arabic but I do not have an Arabic keyboard.
# What would you do with donations?
First of all I think donations will come later on. That means if and only
if the project grows (because I do not want waste anyone's money).
The first thing I would is rent a server to host memorev and rent a domain.
